    <h2>Alumna Annika ten Velden</h2>
    <h4>Security consultant, NVISO</h4>
    <p>After my Master in Crimonology, I was looking for a <strong>dedicated education</strong> in IT-security and <strong>forensic investigation.</strong> The bachelor program Cyber Security Professional corresponded perfectly with my needs. As my background was in social sciences rather than in technical sciences, I did expect a challenge. As Howest focuses on the <strong>practical</strong> rather than the theoretical and offers extra support where necessary, I achieved my degree without a problem.</p>
    <p>Because of the <strong>profound knowledge acquired in IT-security</strong> – from pentesting to forensic analysis – I received many job offers. My work at NVISO for the last five years has focused on incident response and forensic investigations. I still have regular contact with Howest and can tell from its trainees that <strong>education continuously evolves</strong> and is adapted to the needs of the employer community.</p>
